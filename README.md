Bitcoin tech explained simply. This page is intended for newcomers to be able to grasp what is going on in the Bitcoin ecosystem without
having to dive into highly technical documentation. As such the writing style here may differ from other more accurate and descriptive sources.

Namely, we should:
- Focus more on user-facing effects, in many cases these may be second order effects of a technology rather than its base purpose
- Aim to use as simple language as possible and avoid idioms so that even non-native English speakers can understand Bitcoin
- Want to avoid analogies *unless* they are close to 1-to-1 comparisons and broadly understood
- Add more languages
