<p>
    CTV is in many ways like Taproot, a more flexible and private way to use Bitcoin.
    Taproot covers the various things that can be done in a script while CTV lays out the pathway
    to do them.
</p>

<p>
    One interesting side-effect of this proposal is that it lets you store transactions
    so you can use scripts without needing direct access to your private keys.
