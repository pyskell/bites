    When you spend on Bitcoin you send money and another address receives money at the same exact time.
    This is great for simple value transfers but falls apart when you need to pay a lot of addresses at once as fees become high and block space is limited.

    Imagine a company has 10,000 BTC that they need to send to 100,000 addresses, and they need to do it all today.
    This is a process that's impossible in many payment systems today and only a few highly centralized custom-built systems can do it.
    CTV brings this process to Bitcoin by allowing one transaction to be guaranteed 
    for many recipients without immediately recording who the recipients are on the Bitcoin network.

    By separating the sending and receiving of a payment CTV allows for all sorts of bigger and more flexible transactions.
    In many ways a CTV is an IOU that is guaranteed by the Bitcoin network rather than a non-guaranteed IOU by the person or entity who gave you the IOU.

    CTV is currently a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal at draft status which means it may make its way into the bitcoind
    software.

    Presently many payment systems solve the problem of large transaction sizes by increasing raw throughput,
    issuing IOUs, and settling the transaction later. Both of these approaches, while effective, unfortunately create
    highly centralized systems that regularly exclude people and refuse to make good on their debts.
