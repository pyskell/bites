<p>
    Keysend (formerly Sphinx Send) is a way to store your friend's and family's public keys and send them Bitcoin.
    Your friend sends you an invoice, your wallet takes some data out of it and saves it to your phone with a nickname
    you choose.
    This is akin to saving your friend's phone number in your phone, except now you're saving their Lightning "address".

    It's in development and has recently made its way into a piece of Lightning software called LND.
    Lightning enthusiasts are using it to send payments to each other.

    Once stable it'll be a commonly used and private form of contact list

<p>
    Rather than publicly available solutions that give your username to the entire world (like Venmo or Paypal)
    Keysend is private and personalized so you might send Bitcoin to "Mom" but her friends will have her saved as
    "Carol"
    and no one else will have her private contact info.
