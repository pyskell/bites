    Essentially the way Bitcoin addresses and signatures (the things you use to authorize BTC transactions) work are not 
    as efficient or private as they could be. Schnorr is a previously patented type of cryptographic (ie. electronic) signature 
    that improves the privacy and cost of Bitcoin transactions; making them overall cheaper. 
    Schnorr signatures are compiled from 1 or many keys and if they're used for a smart contract that includes 
    multiple parties then it's impossible for any outsider to know what the smart contract did or could have done which means 
    agreements between you and others are kept entirely private, looking just like any other transaction.

    Schnorr is currently a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal at draft status which means it may make its way into the bitcoind software.

{% block future %}
<p>
    If Schnorr is activate on the network no one will be required to use it, 
    but if they choose to then it will provide a more private and cheaper Bitcoin transaction experience. 
    Long term it will help keep the cost to run the Bitcoin network software (aka. bitcoind) low meaning 
    as many people as possible across the world will be able to be a part of the Bitcoin network 
    while preserving the properties of the Bitcoin network.

{% block vs_alts %}
<p>
    Current transactions are generally bigger (ie. more expensive) and less private than Schnorr.
