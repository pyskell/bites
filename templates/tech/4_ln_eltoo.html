Go back and read about Watchtowers first. When watchtowers need to deal with stale IOUs like in the second case 
they may need to send a lot of them to the Bitcoin network to inform it of the final IOU in the chain. 
This process can create large transactions which are expensive. Eltoo allows for not having to do this 
making it much cheaper to prove the chain of IOUs to the Bitcoin network.

<p>
    Eltoo is not currently feasible unless the Bitcoin network adds a new OPCODE called <code>SIGHASH_NOINPUT</code>
</p>

<p>
    If Eltoo is enabled it will make the use of Lightning and other technologies built on Bitcoin much more efficient and cheaper to operate and secure.
