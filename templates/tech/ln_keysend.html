Keysend (formerly Sphinx Send) is a way to store your friend's and family's public keys and send them Bitcoin. 
Your friend sends you an invoice, your wallet takes some data out of it and saves it to your phone with a nickname you choose.

<p>
It's in development and has recently made its way into a piece of Lightning software called LND.
Enthusiasts are using it to send payments to each other by name.

{% block future %}
<p>
Once stable it'll be a commonly used contact list

<p>
Rather than publicly available solutions that give your username to the entire world (like Venmo or Paypal) 
Keysend is private and personalized so you might send Bitcoin to "Mom" but her friends will have her saved as "Carol"
