		<h1>Bitcoin has the hardest tech</h1>
		<p class="lead">
		Bitcoin is not flashy, nor hyped tech. Bitcion is tech that gets serious work done well. 
		Unfortunately this approach often leads to the erroneous and deceptive belief 
		that Bitcoin is technologically archaic, or worse has no development.
		</p>
		<p class="lead">
		As a former Bitcoin newbie myself I can tell you that I spent years viewing Bitcoin as old tech, 
		rather than as tech focused on a singular and vital goal: a native internet currency, 
		that may one day bring to money what the Internet brought to freedom of speech.
		</p>
		<p class="lead">
		Below you will find an ever-incomplete list of emerging Bitcoin tech 
		that serves as a stepping off point for understanding the advancements 
		and freedoms that Bitcoin may one day bring all of us.
		</p>
		<p class="lead">
		Please also keep in mind that this is tech explained simply, as such it will gloss over specific technical details.
		If you're excited by these things and want more in depth and accurate information then please refer to the "Further reading" tabs.
