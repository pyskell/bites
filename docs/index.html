Essentially Lightning is a faster type of Bitcoin transaction, that rather than being sent directly to the Bitcoin network
is sent directly to friends, family, and merchants. Later they may choose to move the BTC they received to the Bitcoin network.
</p>

<p>
When Lightning is mature it will be usable for reasonably sized transactions and purchases between friends and merchants
while the Bitcoin network will remain the preferred method for large transactions.
</p>

<p>
Lightning is in alpha to beta state which means it works most of the time but may have bugs.
Lightning wallets continuously improve in security and quality. The leading Lightning wallets are generally simple and easy to use.
</p>

<p>
At the moment you should only use small amounts of BTC on Lightning due to risks related to the early nature of the Lightning ecosystem.
</p>

                </p>

                    <p>
                    
<p>
When Lightning is mature it will be usable for most reasonably sized transactions between friends and merchants 
and you won't need to worry about your wallet monitoring the Bitcoin network because they all will.
</p>

<p>
Most importantly when Lightning is mature you may not even know you're using it, 
you'll just open your wallet and pay. Your wallet will then make a smart decision
on how to send the BTC, whether that be on Lightning, on the Bitcoin network, 
or on another payment system. Some Lightning wallets already do this today.
</p>

<p>
Of course Bitcoin tech is all about freedom, so if you want to take more 
fine-grained control over your money you'll be able to do that as well.
</p>

                </p>

                <p>
                    
<p>
Lightning is best thought of as Bitcoin's version of a credit card network (like Visa or Mastercard). 
With this in mind Lightning will enable an experience that's like a credit card with much more privacy. 

An important part of Lightning is that its design and development effort is going into 
making sure that when you buy something no one else is storing your entire shopping history. 

Today many companies collect our data and use it manipulate us into purchasing things we don't need 
and then sell our data to others who really shouldn't have it. 

Lightning will make it so that only the buyer and seller know each other and no other parties have access to the transaction. 
In that way Lightning (and Bitcoin) is much more like cash than a credit card.

Your friend sends you an invoice, your wallet takes some data out of it and saves it to your phone with a nickname you choose.

"All Lightning transactions are essentially multisignature bitcoin transactions (ie. requiring a predefined number of keys to spend, rather than just one). Typically these transactions are 2-of-2 multisigs with a timelock (aka. a withdrawal delay). When you move BTC around on the Lightning Network you're essentially sharing IOUs with people. When you eventually want to turn those IOUs into BTC in your wallet you need to ""close"" your Lightning channel. There's two general ways to move BTC out of a Lightning channel:

1. Holders of both keys choose to spend the BTC and agree on the final IOU in the chain of IOUs. You and the person you've sent or received money from each have one of them. Most LN transactions end this way as most parties simply obey the rules.

2. The other way is when the parties disagree, in this case 1 of the 2 keys can move the BTC with a timelock (ie. a delay). One party initiates the withdrawal, then the other party can see this transaction on the Bitcoin network and respond to it, either saying it's fine (ie. they've sent the right IOU), or that it's wrong and providing proof (in the form of more recent IOUs) that they are the rightful owner of the BTC. 

Watchtowers cover the second case, watching the Bitcoin network and making sure that the wrong transactions don't end up on the network sending money to the wrong people."

                    <p>
                    
Eventually Watchtowers will be available everywhere and making fraudulent Lightning transactions by giving the Bitcoin network old IOUs will be practically impossible.

                <p>
                    
Currently Lightning channels are not yet easy to monitor, while the rate of fraud is low it is still feasible and does occasionally happen.

Go back and read about Watchtowers first. When watchtowers need to deal with stale IOUs like in the second case 
they may need to send a lot of them to the Bitcoin network to inform it of the final IOU in the chain. 
This process can create large transactions which are expensive. Eltoo allows for not having to do this 
making it much cheaper to prove the chain of IOUs to the Bitcoin network.

                <p>
                    


                </p>

                    <p>
                    
Eltoo is not currently feasible unless the Bitcoin network adds a new OPCODE called <code>SIGHASH_NOINPUT</code>

If Eltoo is enabled it will make the use of Lightning and other technologies built on Bitcoin much more efficient and cheaper to operate and secure.

Macaroons allow any service (not just websites) to provide you with a bearer token that you can use to identify yourself 
and optionally share with others. This way you can pay for a service with Lightning 
and later use that service at your leisure by providing it with your Macaroon to prove you paid previously.

Every Lightning IOU moves through multiple nodes (aka servers) on its way to its final recipient. 
For each node in its path another layer of encryption is added. 
When a node receives a Lightning IOU it is able to decrypt one, 
and only one of these layers before sending it on to the next node.

This is a secure communication technology used in other software like Tor.

Onion routing is a part of the Lightning network and helps protect every transaction on it.

However keep in mind that no single piece of technology is a magic solution to all issues 
and privacy on Lightning can and will be improved in a variety of ways.

Submarine Swaps bundle the entire process of moving BTC between Bitcoin 
and Lightning networks into one. This allows for seamless payments between BTC 
on the Bitcoin network and BTC IOUs on the Lightning network.

            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="ln-submarine-swaps-status" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="ln-submarine-swaps-status">
                <p>
                    
Submarine Swaps are already available in mobile wallets such as Phoenix Wallet, Breez, and Muun.

                    <p>
                    
They're already here and they work.

                </p>

                <p>
                    
Without Submarine Swaps if you have BTC on the Bitcoin network and wanted to send it over Lightning 
you would first need to make a transaction to create a Lightning channel. Then you would make a 
second transaction sending the BTC IOU over Lightning. This process is cumbersome 
and leads to friction in both the payment process and the UI of Lightning wallets.

Now with submarine swaps the process is a single seamless step.

The naive way of sending money to friends on Lightning is to use BTC from a single Lightning channel. 
However every Lightning channel has a maximum size transaction that it can support. 
This improvement allows you to pay your friends and receive BTC from them using multiple Lightning channels, 
greatly increasing the amount of BTC that can be sent between you and your friends.

Essentially the way Bitcoin addresses and signatures (the things you use to authorize BTC transactions) work are not 
as efficient or private as they could be. Schnorr is a previously patented type of cryptographic (ie. electronic) signature 
that improves the privacy and cost of Bitcoin transactions; making them overall cheaper. 
Schnorr signatures are compiled from 1 or many keys and if they're used for a smart contract that includes 
multiple parties then it's impossible for any outsider to know what the smart contract did or could have done which means 
agreements between you and others are kept entirely private, looking just like any other transaction.

            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="schnorr-status" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="schnorr-status">
                <p>
                    
Schnorr is currently a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal at draft status which means it may make its way into the bitcoind software.

                </p>

                    <p>
                    
If Schnorr is activate on the network no one will be required to use it, 
but if they choose to then it will provide a more private and cheaper Bitcoin transaction experience. 
Long term it will help keep the cost to run the Bitcoin network software (aka. bitcoind) low meaning 
as many people as possible across the world will be able to be a part of the Bitcoin network 
while preserving the properties of the Bitcoin network.

                </p>

                <p>
                    
Current transactions are generally bigger (ie. more expensive) and less private than Schnorr.

Suppose you and 12 other business partners decide to collectively manage BTC for your startup. 
You all want an equal (or maybe unequal) say on what to spend your money on. 
You can store it all in one bank account and share a password, effectively trusting every person to not misbehave. 
Alternatively you can use a solution like Taproot to make sure you have equal (or unequal) 
say on when you can spend your BTC, effectively turning a business contract into an agreement enforced by the Bitcoin network.

Taproot also improves privacy. Today if you and your business partners had such an agreement on the Bitcoin network 
and decided to spend your BTC on a new investment then the moment you did everyone on the Bitcoin network would 
know the wallets of every partner involved in the decision. This is bad if you don't want the world knowing 
the operations of your business. 

With Taproot (really Taproot + Schnorr + Taproot Scripts) you can make sure your transactions reveal much less or, 
in many cases, no information about your operations.

Taproot is currently a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal at draft status which means it may make its way into the bitcoind software.

                </p>

                    <p>
                    
If Taproot is activated all sorts of new types of applications and money management will be available and enforceable by the Bitcoin network. 
Taproot is very much a building block that may allow for types of applications no one has been able to build yet.

                </p>

                <p>
                    
Currently we depend on many centrally controlled services to manage our money and agreements around them. 
Taproot will help us avoid or moderate the power that centralized intermediaries have over our money.

The Bitcoin network's programming language (Script) is a stack based language that is cumbersome to write 
with many edge cases. Miniscript makes it easy to write most Bitcoin scripts in a short bit of code (typically one line) 
with strong guarantees that your code will function correctly.

CTV is in many ways like Taproot, a more flexible and private way to use Bitcoin. 
Taproot covers the various things that can be done in a script while CTV lays out the pathway
to do them.

One interesting side-effect of this proposal is that it lets you store transactions 
so you can use scripts without needing direct access to your private keys.

CTV is currently a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal at draft status which means it may make its way into the bitcoind software.
