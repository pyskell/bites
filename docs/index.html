Essentially Lightning is a faster type of Bitcoin transaction, that rather than being sent directly to the Bitcoin network
is sent directly to friends, family, and merchants. Later they may choose to move the BTC they received to the Bitcoin network.
</p>

<p>
When Lightning is mature it will be usable for reasonably sized transactions and purchases between friends and merchants
while the Bitcoin network will remain the preferred method for large transactions.
</p>

                </p>

<p>
Lightning is in alpha to beta state which means it works most of the time but may have bugs.
Lightning wallets continuously improve in security and quality. The leading Lightning wallets are generally simple and easy to use.
</p>

<p>
At the moment you should only use small amounts of BTC on Lightning due to risks related to the early nature of the Lightning ecosystem.
</p>

                </p>

                    <p>
                    
<p>
When Lightning is mature it will be usable for most reasonably sized transactions between friends and merchants 
and you won't need to worry about your wallet monitoring the Bitcoin network because they all will.
</p>

<p>
Most importantly when Lightning is mature you may not even know you're using it, 
you'll just open your wallet and pay. Your wallet will then make a smart decision
on how to send the BTC, whether that be on Lightning, on the Bitcoin network, 
or on another payment system. Some Lightning wallets already do this today.
</p>

<p>
Of course Bitcoin tech is all about freedom, so if you want to take more 
fine-grained control over your money you'll be able to do that as well.
</p>

                </p>

                <p>
                    
<p>
Lightning is best thought of as Bitcoin's version of a credit card network (like Visa or Mastercard). 
With this in mind Lightning will enable an experience that's like a credit card with much more privacy. 

An important part of Lightning is that its design and development effort is going into 
making sure that when you buy something no one else is storing your entire shopping history. 

Today many companies collect our data and use it manipulate us into purchasing things we don't need 
and then sell our data to others who really shouldn't have it. 

Lightning will make it so that only the buyer and seller know each other and no other parties have access to the transaction. 
In that way Lightning (and Bitcoin) is much more like cash than a credit card.

Go back and read about Watchtowers first. When watchtowers need to deal with stale IOUs like in the second case 
they may need to send a lot of them to the Bitcoin network to inform it of the final IOU in the chain. 
This process can create large transactions which are expensive. Eltoo allows for not having to do this 
making it much cheaper to prove the chain of IOUs to the Bitcoin network.

Keysend (formerly Sphinx Send) is a way to store your friend's and family's public keys and send them Bitcoin. 
Your friend sends you an invoice, your wallet takes some data out of it and saves it to your phone with a nickname you choose.

Rather than publicly available solutions that give your username to the entire world (like Venmo or Paypal)

"All Lightning transactions are essentially multisignature bitcoin transactions (ie. requiring a predefined number of keys to spend, rather than just one). Typically these transactions are 2-of-2 multisigs with a timelock (aka. a withdrawal delay). When you move BTC around on the Lightning Network you're essentially sharing IOUs with people. When you eventually want to turn those IOUs into BTC in your wallet you need to ""close"" your Lightning channel. There's two general ways to move BTC out of a Lightning channel:

1. Holders of both keys choose to spend the BTC and agree on the final IOU in the chain of IOUs. You and the person you've sent or received money from each have one of them. Most LN transactions end this way as most parties simply obey the rules.

2. The other way is when the parties disagree, in this case 1 of the 2 keys can move the BTC with a timelock (ie. a delay). One party initiates the withdrawal, then the other party can see this transaction on the Bitcoin network and respond to it, either saying it's fine (ie. they've sent the right IOU), or that it's wrong and providing proof (in the form of more recent IOUs) that they are the rightful owner of the BTC. 

Watchtowers cover the second case, watching the Bitcoin network and making sure that the wrong transactions don't end up on the network sending money to the wrong people."

Watchtowers are already in a few wallets but they're still in alpha development

                </p>

                    <p>
                    
Eventually Watchtowers will be available everywhere and making fraudulent Lightning transactions by giving the Bitcoin network old IOUs will be practically impossible.

                </p>

                <p>
                    
Currently Lightning channels are not yet easy to monitor, while the rate of fraud is low it is still feasible and does occasionally happen.
